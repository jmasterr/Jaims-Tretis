I want to make this game i know it will be hard.
making this game is getting out of my comfort zone and i dont like it and even tho i know i might not be ready i will try my hardest.
this game that i will make will be a less cool tetris.
i want to have the same mechanics as the original game.
there will be 7 peices of blocks in this game and the user must try to stack them while they are falling from the top of the game board without making any mistakes by not
organizing them where there are no spaces inside the stacked blocks and once you finish a row of blocks that line will disapear and give you points.
the more lines you finish at once the more points you get from that action. once you get to a certain ammount of points.
you reach the next level and the blocks will start falling down faster the higher the level is.
